# EditBox_with_eye

You must have seen a eye image, on clicking which you see the password and on clicking the same you hide it.

To acheive this there could be many a ways, two of them are described below :
1. making a custom edit box.
2. adding a image of eye side by edit box.
-------------------
I have tried to cover both ways in quite simple manner, i hope this helps u :)
